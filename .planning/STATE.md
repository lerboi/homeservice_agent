# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Vapi over raw Twilio+STT — faster to market, proven low-latency voice
- [Init]: Lead tracker only, not full CRM — avoid competing with ServiceTitan/Jobber
- [Init]: Voice-first, defer chat channels — calls are where leads are lost
- [Init]: Multi-language from day one — retrofitting is harder and more expensive
- [Research]: Local DB mirror is source of truth for availability — never query Google/Outlook in call hot path
- [Research]: Redis SET NX + Postgres SELECT FOR UPDATE double-lock for atomic slot reservation
- [Research]: Language abstraction layer must precede any language-specific content (Phase 1 gate)
- [Phase 01]: Use node jest-cli/bin/jest.js instead of .bin/jest shim for Windows bash compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Add type:module to package.json — next.config.js uses ES module syntax
- [Phase 01]: next-intl cookie-based locale without URL prefix routing for API-first multi-tenant app

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Vapi current API shape (assistantOverrides schema, function-call event payload) needs verification against live Vapi docs before webhook handler implementation
- [Phase 3]: Microsoft Graph OAuth tenant consent flow is more complex than Google's — needs targeted research before calendar sync work begins
- [Phase 5]: TCPA compliance review required before any outbound SMS recovery is built (Phase 4 NOTIF-03 is inbound caller SMS, not outbound campaign — this is fine for v1)
